# HealthMonitor-AI Case Study

## Overview

**HealthMonitor-AI** is an intelligent system designed to provide personalized fitness recommendations by monitoring user activity and environmental data. It accepts input data in CSV or JSON formats, rigorously validates the data against predefined rules, and then performs a series of step-by-step calculations. These calculations include computing predicted activity, determining heart rate and environmental categories, assessing ambient temperature impact, and calculating a composite fitness score. All processing steps are clearly explained using simple language and visual formulas, making the system accessible to non-technical users.

## Metadata

- **Project Name:** HealthMonitor-AI  
- **Version:** 1.0.0  
- **Author:** Usman Ashfaq  
- **Keywords:** Health Monitoring, Fitness Recommendations, Data Validation, Step-by-Step Calculations, User Activity, Environmental Data

## Features

- **Data Validation:**  
  HealthMonitor-AI accepts input data only in CSV or JSON formats (enclosed in markdown code blocks) and validates each record for:
  - **Format:** The data must adhere to the provided CSV or JSON structure.
  - **Required Fields:** Each record must include:
    - `user_id`
    - `current_steps`
    - `heart_rate`
    - `ambient_temperature`
    - `environmental_index`
    - `activity_intensity_factor`
  - **Data Integrity:** Ensures that numerical values are positive (where applicable) and that `environmental_index` is between 0 and 100. When errors (such as missing fields or invalid values) are found, the system provides a comprehensive validation report so that users can correct their input.

- **Step-by-Step Calculations:**  
  For each user record, HealthMonitor-AI performs these calculations:
  1. **Predicted Activity Calculation:**  
     - Formula:  
       $$ \text{Predicted Activity} = \text{current_steps} \times \text{activity_intensity_factor} $$
     - Explanation: Multiplies the current step count by a factor that reflects the intensity of the activity.
  2. **Heart Rate Category Determination:**  
     - Uses IF/THEN/ELSE logic:
       - IF heart_rate < 60, THEN "Below Optimal".
       - ELSE IF heart_rate between 60 and 100, THEN "Optimal".
       - ELSE, "Above Optimal".
  3. **Environmental Quality Category Determination:**  
     - Based on the value of environmental_index:
       - IF environmental_index ≥ 75, THEN "Good".
       - ELSE IF environmental_index ≥ 50, THEN "Moderate".
       - ELSE, "Poor".
  4. **Ambient Temperature Impact Assessment:**  
     - Evaluates whether the ambient temperature is ideal:
       - IF ambient_temperature is between 15 and 25, THEN "Ideal Temperature".
       - ELSE IF ambient_temperature < 15, THEN "Too Cold".
       - ELSE, "Too Hot".
  5. **Composite Fitness Score Calculation:**  
     - Formula:  
       $$ \text{Composite Fitness Score} = \left(\frac{\text{Predicted Activity}}{10000} \times 0.5\right) + \left(\text{Heart Rate Factor} \times 0.3\right) + \left(\text{Environmental Factor} \times 0.2\right) $$
     - Explanation: Combines a normalized measure of activity with heart rate and environmental quality factors.
  6. **Final Recommendation:**  
     - Based on the Composite Fitness Score, heart rate category, and ambient temperature impact, the system advises whether to maintain the current fitness plan or adjust it.

- **User Interaction and Feedback:**  
  HealthMonitor-AI interacts with users by:
  - Greeting and offering data input templates.
  - Returning detailed error messages and validation reports when issues are detected.
  - Requesting confirmation before proceeding with analysis.
  - Providing comprehensive final reports that include all calculations and actionable recommendations.

## Variations and Test Flows

### Flow 1: Basic Greeting and Template Request (CSV Data)
- **User Action:**  
  The user greets with a simple "Hi" and then agrees to receive the data input template.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system responds with a friendly greeting and provides both CSV and JSON templates.
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits CSV data containing multiple user records.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  HealthMonitor-AI validates the data, generates a Data Validation Report, and then processes the data to provide detailed step-by-step calculations for each record (e.g., computing predicted activity, categorizing heart rate, assessing environmental quality, and calculating the composite fitness score). The final recommendation is clearly stated for each record.
- **Feedback:**  
  The user finds the analysis clear and appreciates the detailed, step-by-step explanations.

### Flow 2: Direct Data Submission Without Template Request (CSV Data)
- **User Action:**  
  The user declines the template and provides CSV data directly.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system validates the data and returns a Data Validation Report. Upon confirmation from the user, HealthMonitor-AI processes the data and outputs detailed calculations along with the final fitness recommendations.
- **Feedback:**  
  The user rates the report positively due to its clarity and actionable insights.

### Flow 3: Error Handling with Missing Fields (CSV Data)
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits CSV data where one or more records are missing required fields (e.g., `activity_intensity_factor` is omitted in one record).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  HealthMonitor-AI generates a comprehensive Data Validation Report that highlights the missing field and indicates the specific row(s) with the error.
- **User Action:**  
  The user corrects the data and resubmits it.
- **Feedback:**  
  The error handling is effective, and the user is satisfied with the subsequent, corrected analysis.

### Flow 4: Error Handling with Invalid Values (JSON Data)
- **User Action:**  
  The user submits JSON data with at least 10 records, but one record contains an invalid value (e.g., an `environmental_index` outside the 0–100 range).
- **Assistant Response:**  
  The system detects the invalid value and returns a detailed Data Validation Report identifying the problematic record and field.
- **User Action:**  
  The user corrects the error by providing the updated JSON data.
- **Assistant Response:**  
  After validating the corrected data, HealthMonitor-AI proceeds with the full analysis, generating a detailed report with step-by-step calculations and final recommendations for each user record.
- **Feedback:**  
  The user appreciates the comprehensive error messages and the clarity of the final analysis.

#### Example Final Report for Flow 4 (Summary):

*HealthMonitor-AI evaluates the health data for 10 users. For each user record, the system computes the predicted activity by multiplying current steps with the activity intensity factor, categorizes heart rate and environmental quality, assesses ambient temperature impact, and calculates a composite fitness score. Based on these metrics, the system recommends whether to continue the current fitness plan or adjust it. The detailed calculations are explained using simple formulas and logical steps, ensuring transparency and ease of understanding for non-technical users.*
